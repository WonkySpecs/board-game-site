        "You want a social experience. The average game of Splendor doesn't involve much talking (sometimes you can hear the brain-gears grinding).",

        "Fast to play, nice components, and simple rules make Splendor a famously great gateway game.",
        "The expansion is fine. Get it if you love the base game, but it's not required."
