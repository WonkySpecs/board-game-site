Cockroach Poker is a game that delights in simplicity. A full rules explanation only takes a minute or two, even for irregular gamers, and the game play is lightning quick. This, combined with the fun creepy-crawly theme, charming art style, and the great deal of (social) interaction involved make Cockroach Poker a really great light game, particularly suited for parties, as an intro game, or for playing with kids.

There are three distinct bits of fun which stand out in Cockroach Poker. The first comes when you slide a card to someone, proclaiming in your most confident voice that it is, in fact, a fly. Except it isn't, and you know it isn't. And so do the last two people that have passed the card around, and who are now doing their best not to smirk. Keeping your cool as you pray you were convincing and/or confounding enough to not be called to task is a small, delicious moment of tension which permeates the game. The feeling is only heightened by the knowing glances between the other people in on the secret, and the sprinkling of extra risk when the suit in play is particularly dangerous for you.

The flipside of those moments is the second great part of the game. Feeling smug as you read your friend's mind four times in a row is undeniably one of the best parts of any bluffing game, and Cockroach Poker gives players plenty of chances to do just that. Finally, there are many great moments to be had simply observing. Good-natured teasing, gasps of surprise, and howls of anguish are all to be found here, in equal measure, all of which make for a good time. Due to the pace of the game, and the 'one loser' ending condition, every moment feels connected for everyone, and the game never drags.

The brilliance of Cockroach Poker is how well it balances all of these experiences. The rules naturally lead to everyone being pulled in and out of great moments constantly, the unstructured turn order means, even at higher end of the player count, there is basically never downtime, and the shifting nature of the game's challendge makes it engaging for its entire, very succinct, playtime. No game is perfect, of course - Cockroach Poker is not a deep game, and I could see its charm wearing off with repeated plays. However, as something to pull out as an opening for a game night, or to get someone who's not normally a gamer to try something new, or as a (potentially rather heavy) drinking game, this little box is more than a little bit magic.
