## Why NAME?

I love board games, and like every other board gamer, that means I love finding new ones to play. The hobby is in an incredible place right now, with so many high quality experiences being released that it's impossible to try them all, let alone account for the huge backlog of classics. Ideally it'd be possible to find and play only the absolute best, but personal taste means 'best' can vary wildly from person to person. This makes collating information from as many places as possible a good idea, and many great places to do so are out there, however I noticed that:

 - A lot of board game reviews are very in depth, often including long rules explanations whiich may be a little more than is really needed.
 - Most games have a small 'fun core' - the good feeling bits that make a game worth playing - and a handful downsides, which for some won't matter and for others may be dealbreakers.

Every minute spent looking up games is a minute not spent playing them, and from an unfortunately limited set of minutes it felt like a waste sitting through 15 minute videos and reviews that copy pasted the manual just to find out the game isn't going to be something'll I'll like. Thus, NAME - every game reviewed is one I've really enjoyed, and think I've found the fun core of, and each summary and review will try to get those bits across as concisely as possible. Whether it's the beginning or end of your search for the next game in your collection, hopefully these reviews can help you on your way without wasting a second of your time.

Of course, everything here is _entirely_ based on my opinion. To that end, I've also included a list games I either didn't like, or don't feel I've gotten a good enough grip on to review yet under the 'Other Games' tab. Give it a once-over, and if you find yourself thinking 'What is this guy talking about? These are my favourite games!', perhaps the site is not for you. That said, maybe that guy/gal at your local group who you can never seem to agree on what to play with would find something useful.
