## Why NAME?

I love board games, and like every other board gamer, that means I love finding new ones to play. The hobby is in an incredible place right now, with so many high quality experiences being released that it's impossible to try them all, even without accounting for the huge, and ever-growing, backlog of classics. Ideally it'd be possible to find and play only the absolute best, but personal taste means what is 'best', in life and board games, varies wildly from person to person. This makes collating information from as many sources as possible a good idea, and whilst there are many great places to do so are out there, I noticed that:

 - A lot of board game reviews are very in-depth, often including long rules explanations.
 - Most games have a small core of things that make them enjoyable, and a handful downsides which for some won't matter, but for others will be dealbreakers.

Every minute spent looking up games is a minute not spent playing them, and from an unfortunately limited set of minutes it sometimes feels like a waste to sit through 15 minute videos, or reviews that copy pasted the manual, just to find out the game isn't going to be something'll I'll like. Thus, NAME - every game reviewed is one I've really enjoyed, and think I've got a grasp on what makes it good. Each summary and review will try to get those bits across as concisely as possible, so that whether it's the beginning or end of your search for the next game in your collection, they can help you on your way without wasting a second of your time.

Of course, that makes everything here based _entirely_ on my opinion. To that end, I've also included a list of games I either didn't like, or don't feel I've gotten a good enough grip on to review yet, under the 'Other Games' tab. Give it a once-over, and if you find yourself thinking 'What is this guy talking about? These are my favourite games!', perhaps the site is not for you. That said, maybe that guy/gal at your local group who you can never seem to agree on what to play with would find something useful.
