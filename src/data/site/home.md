## Welcome

Welcome to FIGURE OUT A GODDAMN NAME, where you can find **to-the-point, insightful summaries and reviews of really great board games**. Not included are long rules explanations, or in-depth explorations of mechanics; both can be useful, but are the focus of an awful lot of other board game coverage. Instead, the reviews here get right to the heart of what makes these games fun to play, to help you find the perfect game for you and the people you play with.
