## Welcome

Welcome to FIGURE OUT A GODDAMN NAME, where you can find **to-the-point, insightful summaries and reviews of really great board games**. Not included are long rules explanations, or any in-depth exploration of mechanics; both can be useful, but are the focus of far too many online reviews. Instead, the reviews here get right to the heart of what makes these games fun to play, to help you find the perfect game for you and the people you play with.
