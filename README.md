# Still in need of a name

Welcome to the source code for this temporarily unnamed, unreleased board game review/summary site.

The site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and (is planned to be) deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at [A domain I haven't bought yet](#). After installing gatsby, the site can be ran locally with the command `gatsby develop` or `gatsby build` followed by `gatsby serve` from the root folder, for development/'production' versions, respectively.

The review content and metadata can be found under `src/data`.
